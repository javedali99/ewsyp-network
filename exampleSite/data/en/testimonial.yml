      Technologically, we are able to do it. We are able to provide the science. We have the computational power. We have the global forecasts at reasonable
      resolutions. They are not perfect but we are able to do them. The big problem is the translation of that information into actual actionable decisions at local scales. I think that gap is still massive.

    content: 'I think one of the challenges is to bring new ideas to the existing
      system. It is not only about how to convince people, but also how to show the
      value of new opportunities, new data, new techniques. Itâ€™s sometimes difficult
      to bring changes to existing systems and I think this can be an important role
      for the young professionals: to make a connection that helps to bridge the gap
      between existing systems and new opportunities that might better fit the operational
      reality of the field.
